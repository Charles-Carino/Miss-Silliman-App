  - please check Data Dictionary. there are clarifications there
    that needs to be answered
  - updated the migration files found at database/migrations
    they will be updated again once Data Dictionary is now finalized.
    also when naming the migrations for uniformity and organization,
    please set the date of when you edited it and how many times you've edited it for
    that day to keep track of changes. (you will need to change the names of migration files if there are edits
    but if everything is fine, disregard this statement. will do my best to reduce
    renaming of migration files because it's tedious to drop the database at localhost and entering
    again the fields hehe)
  - View and Model will be connected soon once Migrations are final :)

  God bless us all :D
